# EDARK — Prepare PRD (Tab 1 · Prepare)

**Scope:** everything from the dataset handed to `edark()` up to the working dataset used by Explore and Analyze — launch validation, type casting, column selection, variable transforms, row filters, Apply, and data preview.
**Master PRD:** [PRD_0_Master.md](PRD_0_Master.md) — principles (§M2–M3), state ownership (§M5), cross-stage data flow (§M6).
**Implementation details:** [IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md](IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md) §N3.

---

## P1 — Purpose and Scope

Prepare turns the raw dataset into the **working dataset** — the cohort every later stage analyses. It covers three independent concerns: **which columns** are kept, **how variables are transformed**, and **which rows** are kept. All three are staged and take effect together on Apply (§M3.1). The original dataset is never modified; the working dataset is always rebuilt from it.

---

## P2 — Launch: Validation, Auto-Cast, Type Detection

### P2.1 Input Validation (`validate_input()`)
Runs before Shiny starts. Stops with a clear message if:
- `dataset` is not a `data.frame` (tibbles are data frames);
- it has 0 rows or 0 columns;
- `max_factor_levels` is not a single positive integer.

### P2.2 Auto-Cast Rules (`cast_column_types()`)
Applied once at launch, in priority order; each column takes the first rule that matches.

| Priority | Condition | Action |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Column is `Date` | Convert to `POSIXct` at midnight UTC |
| 2 | Column is `logical` | Convert to factor with levels `c("FALSE", "TRUE")` |
| 3 | Column is `character` and every non-NA value parses as a number | Convert to numeric |
| 4 | Column is `character` with ≤ `max_factor_levels` distinct non-NA values | Convert to factor |
| 5 | Anything else | Leave unchanged |

`max_factor_levels` defaults to 20 and is an argument of `edark()` and `edark_report()`.

### P2.3 Type Detection (`detect_column_types()`)
Returns a named character vector mapping each column to one EDARK type: `"numeric"`, `"factor"`, `"datetime"` or `"character"`. At launch the result is stored twice: `original_column_types` (never changes) and `column_types` (re-detected from the working dataset after every Apply). The two diverge intentionally — e.g. a numeric column turned into a factor by a transform.

---

## P3 — Layout

- **Left sidebar (400 px):** the Apply panel (§P7).
- **Main area:** `navset_card_tab` with four sub-tabs — **Columns** (§P4), **Transforms** (§P5), **Row Filters** (§P6), **Data Preview** (§P8).
- Switching sub-tabs auto-applies staged changes (§P7.3).

---

## P4 — Columns

A compact table with one row per column of the original dataset.

| Element | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Include checkbox (per row) | Checked = column kept. All checked by default. |
| Select all / Deselect all | Toggle every row. |
| Column name, type, unique count | Read-only description of the column. |

- Excluded columns disappear from every downstream picker after Apply.
- Excluding a column that has an active row filter removes that filter on Apply, with a warning in the Apply panel (§P7.1).
- **Type overrides:** the pipeline supports per-column type overrides (`column_type_overrides`, applied first in §P7.2), but no UI exposes them — the Columns tab is include/exclude only. Type changes are made through transforms.

---

## P5 — Transforms

### P5.1 Table
One row per numeric column. Eligibility uses `original_column_types`, so every column that was numeric at launch always appears (even after a transform has turned it into a factor). Each row has a **Transform** dropdown; methods that need settings show them inline below the row.

Transform specs persist through Apply: returning to the tab shows the currently applied transforms. Choosing **None** removes a column's transform.

### P5.2 Methods

| Method | Output type | Settings | Invalid when |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Auto-factor** (`auto`) | ordered factor — each unique value becomes a level | — | never |
| **Cut points** (`cutpoints`) | ordered factor | breakpoints (comma-separated); optional level labels | no valid breakpoint inside the data range |
| **Log transform** (`log`) | numeric | base: ln / log10 / log2 | any value ≤ 0 |
| **Winsorize** (`winsorize`) | numeric | lower and upper percentile | lower percentile ≥ upper |
| **Round** (`round`) | numeric | decimal places | never |
| **Standardize** (`standardize`) | numeric (z-score: mean 0, SD 1) | — | SD = 0 |

### P5.3 Cut-Point Labels
Breakpoints outside the data range are dropped silently. Default labels describe the ranges — e.g. breakpoints `25, 40` → `"< 25"`, `"25 – < 40"`, `"≥ 40"`. User-supplied labels replace them.

### P5.4 Validity and Navigation
An invalid transform is flagged in the Apply panel (§P7.1). Apply and sub-tab switches are blocked until it is fixed or removed, because applying it would mangle the column.

---

## P6 — Row Filters

- **Add filter:** pick any included column; a filter card is added for it.
- **Numeric columns:** range slider (min / max) within the observed data range.
- **Factor / character columns:** choose which levels to keep; all selected by default.
- Filters combine with **AND**.
- Filters can be changed or removed at any time before Apply.
- A filter on a column that is excluded, or that has a transform staged, is removed on Apply with a warning (its levels or range would no longer match the transformed column).

---

## P7 — Apply, Reset, and the Pipeline

### P7.1 Apply Panel (sidebar)
- **Dimensions:** Original, Current (applied) and Pending (what Apply would produce) rows × columns; Pending is highlighted when changes are staged.
- **Status:** pending-changes badge when staged ≠ applied.
- **Warnings**, grouped: transforms that need attention; transforms staged on filtered columns; excluded columns with active filters.
- **Apply Changes** (primary) and **Reset to Original**.

### P7.2 Pipeline Order (mandatory)
The working dataset is always rebuilt from the original, in this order:

1. Start from `dataset_original`
2. Apply column type overrides
3. Select included columns
4. Apply column transforms
5. Apply row filters

Row filters run last so they act on the final (possibly transformed) values.

### P7.3 When the Pipeline Runs
- **Apply Changes** button.
- **Switching Prepare sub-tabs** while changes are pending (auto-apply) — so Data Preview always shows applied data. Blocked, with an error, while any transform is invalid.

### P7.4 After a Successful Apply
`dataset_working` is replaced; `column_types` is re-detected; `has_pending_changes` is cleared; `explore_needs_refresh` is set (Explore shows a stale notice, §E6); `last_applied_specs` is snapshotted (used by revert, and by Analyze at freeze — §M6.6). A brief "Changes applied." notification confirms it.

### P7.5 Reset and the Custom-Report Guard
- **Reset to Original** clears all staged specs and restores the working dataset to the original.
- If Explore custom report items exist, Apply, Reset and auto-apply first show **"Custom Report May Be Affected"**: continue (and clear the custom report) or **go back and revert** — which restores every staged spec to the last applied state and resyncs every Prepare tab (§M6.5).

---

## P8 — Data Preview

Two panels — **Original** and **Working** — each with two sub-tabs:
- **Data:** interactive, searchable `reactable` of the dataset. In the Working view, transformed columns are tinted amber.
- **Summary:** one row per column — type, missing, unique, mean, median, skewness, kurtosis, top values.

---

## P9 — Dataset Export *(backlog, not built)*

Planned: download the working dataset (RDS / CSV), and optionally the original dataset plus the Prepare specs that reproduce it. This overlaps with Analyze Step 8's data export (§A10) and session files (§M8); the three should share one writer. See §M7.
