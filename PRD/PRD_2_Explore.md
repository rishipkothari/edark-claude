# EDARK — Explore PRD (Tab 2 · Explore: Plot and Report)

**Scope:** Tab 2, which has two sub-tabs — **Plot** (interactive exploration: Describe, Correlate, Trend) and **Report** (Full and Custom PPTX / DOCX / HTML reports, plus the programmatic report API).
**Master PRD:** [PRD_0_Master.md](PRD_0_Master.md) — principles (§M2–M3), state ownership (§M5), Explore → Report flow (§M6.4).
**Implementation details:** [NOTE_implementation.md](NOTE_implementation.md) §N4 (Explore), §N5 (Report). Statistical rules: §A4.2 / §N2.

# Part I — Plot

## E1 — Purpose and Scope

Explore lets the user look at the working dataset one variable, one relationship, or one time trend at a time, with a summary table beside each plot. Everything reads `dataset_working`; nothing modifies it. Plots are static `ggplot2` objects — the same object is shown on screen and written to reports (§M2.2).

---

## E2 — Layout

- **Left sidebar (400 px):** `navset_pill` with three mode pills — **Describe** (§E3), **Correlate** (§E4), **Trend** (§E5) — plus an **Appearance** panel (§E7). Appearance sits in the same row without being a mode: the three modes stage their settings, Appearance applies live.
- **Main area:** one shared output panel (§E6). All three pills write `plot_specification`; the latest click wins.
- Sidebar convention: flat sections, small uppercase section labels, one full-width primary button per pill. Aesthetics are not per-pill - they have their own **Appearance** panel (§E7).

---

## E3 — Describe

| Element | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Variable | Numeric and factor columns (datetime excluded) |
| Stratify by | Optional; factor columns |
| Factor statistic | Count or proportion — shown only for factor variables |
| **Describe** (primary) | Builds a univariate spec → `bar_count` (factor) or `histogram_density` (numeric) |

---

## E4 — Correlate

UI label **Correlate**; code calls it the relationship tab (`relationship_controls_*`).

| Element | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Primary variable + role | Numeric and factor columns; role **Exposure (X)** or **Outcome (Y)** |
| Secondary variable | Numeric and factor columns, excluding the primary |
| Factor statistic | Count or proportion, when relevant |
| Stratify by | Optional; factor columns only; excludes the primary |
| **Plot Relationship** (primary) | Builds a bivariate spec |

**Axis assignment:** exposure → primary on X; outcome → primary on Y. Then, for factor × numeric, axes are normalised so the factor is always on X.

**Routing (`route_plot_type()`):**

| X type | Y type | Plot type |
|---|---|---|
| factor | factor | `bar_grouped` |
| factor | numeric | `violin_jitter` |
| numeric | factor | `violin_jitter` (axes normalised) |
| numeric | numeric | `scatter_loess` |

Datetime pairings are not routed; Trend handles time (§E5). An unsupported combination renders a warning card instead of a plot.

---

## E5 — Trend

| Element | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Timestamp | Datetime columns only |
| Resolution | Hour · Day · Week · Month (default) · Quarter · Year |
| Trend variable | **Required.** Numeric or factor column |
| Statistic (numeric) | `mean_only`, `mean_sd` (default), `mean_se`, `mean_ci`, `median_only`, `median_iqr`, `count`, `sum`, `max`, `min` |
| Statistic (factor) | Count or proportion |
| Impute zero for missing timepoints | Factor trends only; default on |
| Stratify by | Optional; factor columns |
| Include zero baseline | Checkbox; default off |
| **Plot Trend** (primary) | Builds a trend spec directly (bypasses routing) |

**Plot types:** numeric variable → `trend_numeric`; factor variable → `trend_factor`.

**Behaviour:**
- Interval statistics (`mean_sd`, `mean_se`, `mean_ci`, `median_iqr`) draw a ribbon; the others draw line + points. `mean_ci` is the t-based CI of the mean.
- **Stratified numeric trend:** one coloured line per stratum on a single panel (no facets).
- **Stratified factor trend:** one facet per stratum; factor levels as coloured lines within each facet.
- **Impute zero:** builds the complete time × level (× stratum) grid and fills gaps with zero counts; a timepoint whose levels are all zero gets proportion 0, not NaN. Takes effect on the next Plot Trend click.
- **Zero baseline:** extends the y-axis to include 0. Re-renders live like an aesthetic (§E7).

---

## E6 — Output Panel

| Element | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Plot | The current plot. Empty-state guidance before the first plot. |
| Summary table | `reactable` summary of the plotted variable (§E6.1). For trends, the trend variable. |
| **Save Plot** | Download the current plot as an image. |
| **Copy to Clipboard** | Copy the current plot image. |
| **Add to Custom Report** | Append the current spec + thumbnail to the Custom Report (§E12). |
| **View Report** | Switch to the Report sub-tab, Custom Report pill. |
| Stale notice | After a Prepare Apply, the panel says the dataset has changed and clears the old plot until the user re-plots (§M3.4). |

### E6.1 Variable Summary (`build_variable_summary()`)
- **Numeric:** n, missing, missing %, mean, median, SD, IQR, min, max, skewness, kurtosis.
- **Factor / character:** n, missing, missing %, unique levels, mode, mode frequency, mode %.
- **Datetime:** n, missing, missing %, earliest, latest, range in days.

---

## E7 — Aesthetics

One app-level setting, in one place: the **Appearance** panel of the Explore config pane, in the same pill row as Describe / Correlate / Trend (`R/module_appearance.R`). There is exactly one copy of the controls and one set of stored values, and the Appearance module is their only writer.

These are the only Explore settings that re-render **live** (§M2.3): the stored spec is reused and only styling changes. That is why they sit apart from the mode panels, whose pickers are all staged until that mode's button is clicked — the split removes a collision the old per-pill accordion created (BUILD_UI-redesign §2.6, D9).

The same values drive the plot on screen, **Full Report** generation, and each **Custom Report** item at the moment it is added (§E12). Report has no aesthetics controls of its own (D7): a generated document reproduces what was on screen.

| Setting | Options | Default |
|---|---|---|
| Plot theme | Minimal · Publication · Cowplot · Economist · FiveThirtyEight · Tufte · Modern | Minimal |
| Colour palette | Set2 · Set1 · Dark2 · Paired · Accent · Blues · Greens · Reds · Purples | Set2 |
| Show data labels | on / off | off |
| Show legend | on / off | on |
| Legend position | right · left · top · bottom | top |

## E8 — Plot Types

### E8.1 Catalogue

| Plot type | Used for | Key behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| `bar_count` | One factor | NA dropped; natural level order (no frequency reordering); count or proportion |
| `histogram_density` | One numeric | Two panels: histogram + density, and a Q-Q plot with symmetric axes |
| `bar_grouped` | Factor × factor | Every X × fill combination shown, missing combinations as zero-height bars |
| `violin_jitter` | Factor × numeric | Violin + jittered points + median marker; NA shown as its own level; legend always hidden |
| `scatter_loess` | Numeric × numeric | Points + LOESS smooth; Pearson r label (p and CI from the shared engine, §N2). Stratified: colour + facet, legend hidden |
| `trend_numeric` | Datetime × numeric | Summary statistic per period (§E5) |
| `trend_factor` | Datetime × factor | Count or proportion per level per period (§E5) |

### E8.2 Titles and Facets
- Title: `X [× Y] [· stratified by S]`.
- Facet strips show `variable: value`.

### E8.3 Two-Panel Plots
`histogram_density` is shown as one side-by-side figure in the app (≈ 45 : 55). In reports its two panels are placed separately (§E13).

### E8.4 Stratification Summary

| Plot type | Stratified by |
|---|---|
| `bar_count`, `bar_grouped` | Fill colour |
| `violin_jitter` | Facets |
| `scatter_loess` | Colour + facets |
| `histogram_density` | Facets |
| `trend_numeric` | Coloured lines, one panel |
| `trend_factor` | Facets |

---

## E9 — Explore State Fields

| Group | Fields |
|---|---|
| Describe / Correlate | `primary_variable`, `primary_variable_role` (default `"exposure"`), `secondary_variable`, `stratify_variable`, `bar_display` (count / proportion) |
| Trend | `trend_timestamp_variable`, `trend_variable`, `trend_summary_stat` (default `"mean_sd"`), `trend_resolution` (default `"Month"`), `trend_stratify_variable`, `trend_zero_baseline`, `trend_impute_zero` (default TRUE) |
| Plot | `plot_specification`, `active_plot`, `variable_summary`, `explore_needs_refresh` |
| Aesthetics | `ggplot_theme`, `color_palette`, `show_data_labels`, `show_legend`, `legend_position` |
| Custom report | `custom_report_items`, `requested_tab`, `requested_report_subtab` |

Trend fields are separate from Describe / Correlate fields; the pills do not share variable selections.

# Part II — Report

## E10 — Purpose and Layout

The Report sub-tab turns the working dataset into a slide deck or document. Two pills:
- **Full Report** (§E11) — generated automatically from chosen variables.
- **Custom Report** (§E12) — the plots the user added from Plot, in the user's order.

Each pill has a sidebar with **Generate & Download** (primary), **Output Format** (PowerPoint · Word · HTML) and its own options. Output Format also offers **In App** (§E11.4), which swaps the primary action for **Generate Preview**. Neither pill has aesthetics controls: both generate with the values in force in **Appearance** (§E7), so the document matches the plot on screen (D7). Generation runs in a blocking progress modal (§M3.5).

Datetime columns are excluded from reports.

---

## E11 — Full Report

### E11.1 Report Types

| UI label | `report_type` | Content |
|---|---|---|
| **Describe Variables** | `all_vars` | One section per selected numeric / factor variable: univariate plot + summary table. Optional stratify adds per-stratum columns. |
| **Correlation** | `primary_vs_others` | One section per secondary variable against a primary variable (with role). A single global stratify applies to all sections. |

Variables are chosen in a **Select Variables** modal.

### E11.2 Report Contents Options
- **Dataset Summary** (default on): one row per numeric / factor variable across the dataset, linked to its section in HTML.
- **Table One** (default off; Describe Variables only): classic clinical Table 1 — numeric rows mean ± SD with Kruskal-Wallis p; factor rows N per level with chi-square / Fisher's p. Columns: `Overall (N = x)`, one per stratum, `p-value`. Rendered before the dataset summary; stratified by the sidebar Stratify By.
- **Collinearity** (default off): the Analyze Step 3 collinearity view over the same variables as Table One - a Pearson r heatmap of the numeric variables, a Cramer's V heatmap of the factors (each needs at least two of its type), and a table of pairs above 0.7. Numeric x factor pairs are not measured. Rendered after Table One, before the dataset summary; omitted when fewer than two numeric or two factor variables qualify.

### E11.3 Overlap Guards
- Correlation skips a secondary variable equal to the stratify variable, and the variable modal hides it.
- Describe Variables drops the stratify variable from its section list.

### E11.4 In-App Preview
- **In App** builds the HTML report and shows it in the centre pane instead of downloading it. The section list returns when the preview is closed.
- A toolbar above the preview carries **Save HTML** (downloads the file already built, no regeneration) and **Close Preview**.
- Changing any setting, the variables, the aesthetics or the working dataset after generating raises a stale message; the preview is not rebuilt until **Generate Preview** is clicked again. **Save HTML** saves the preview as shown.
- To export as PowerPoint or Word, pick that format and use **Generate & Download**.
- Custom Report has the same option; its preview goes in a tab of its own (§E12).

---

## E12 — Custom Report

- **Add to Custom Report** in the Plot output panel snapshots the current plot spec and a thumbnail, with the aesthetics in force at that moment written into the item's own spec. Items added under different appearance settings therefore keep their own look; nothing restyles them at generation time.
- The centre has two tabs: **Items**, the queued list with move up / move down / remove (the info pane previews the selected item's thumbnail), and **Preview**, the In App report (§E11.4). Generate Preview switches to the Preview tab; Close Preview switches back to Items. Reordering, adding or removing items marks the preview stale.
- At generation time each item is **re-rendered from the current working dataset** — the data is not snapshotted.
- An item whose columns no longer exist renders a placeholder; the rest of the report still generates (§M3.7).
- Trend items contribute a plot only (no table).
- Prepare warns before applying changes while items exist (§P7.5).

---

## E13 — Output Formats

Every report may open with Table One, Collinearity and / or the Dataset Summary, then one section per item. **A plot and its table never share a slide or page.**

| Format | Engine | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **HTML** | `rmarkdown` + `inst/report_template.Rmd` | Floating table of contents; section anchors; dataset-summary variable names link to their sections; back-to-top links |
| **PowerPoint** | `officer` + `rvg` (+ `inst/templates/ppt_16x9_blank_template.pptx`) | Plots as editable vector graphics; multi-panel figures rasterised |
| **Word** | `officer` + `flextable` | No reference template yet (backlog) |

Two-panel plots (`histogram_density`) are split into two figures in every format.

---

## E14 — Section Tables

| Report type | Variables | Table |
|---|---|---|
| Describe | numeric | Statistic · Overall · [stratum …] |
| Describe | factor | Level · N · % · [per stratum] |
| Correlation | numeric × numeric | r, R², p, 95% CI (Pearson) |
| Correlation | numeric × factor | N / mean / median / SD / IQR per level + Kruskal-Wallis p |
| Correlation | factor × factor | Cross-tab N (%) + chi-square / Fisher's p |

All tests come from the shared statistical engine (§N2).

## E15 — Programmatic API

The report pipeline runs without Shiny.

```r
edark_report(liver_tx, report_format = "html",
             output_path = tempfile(fileext = ".html"))

edark_report(liver_tx, report_type = "primary_vs_others",
             primary_variable = "age_tx", primary_role = "exposure",
             stratify_variable = "graft_type",
             report_format = "pptx", output_path = tempfile(fileext = ".pptx"))
```

`edark_report(data, report_type = "all_vars", variables = NULL, primary_variable = NULL, primary_role = "exposure", stratify_variable = NULL, report_format = "html", output_path = NULL, max_factor_levels = 20)` validates and casts the data like `edark()` (§P2), then calls `generate_report()`.

`generate_report()` and `generate_custom_report()` take plain arguments (dataset, column types, format, output path, aesthetics, optional `progress_fn(fraction, detail)`), so the same code serves the app's download buttons and scripts. `generate_custom_report()`'s aesthetic arguments default to `NULL`, meaning "keep the appearance each item was captured with" — which is how the app calls it. Passing a value overrides *every* item, for programmatic callers who want one consistent look. `generate_report()`'s `include_dataset_summary` / `include_tableone` / `include_collinearity` default to on / off / off.
