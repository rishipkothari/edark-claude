# CLAUDE.md — EDARK v0.2

EDARK is an R package: an interactive Shiny GUI for preparing, exploring, reporting on and modelling tabular clinical research data. `edark(dataset)` → **1 · Prepare** → **2 · Explore** (Plot + Report) → **3 · Analyze**.

This file is the **index**: where to find things, the rules that must never be broken, current state, and doc/code discrepancies. Specs and mechanics live in the documents below — read the relevant section before changing code. What each `R/` file *does* is in the root `CLAUDE.md`; which `§` sections govern it is below.

## Where to Find What

| Document | Prefix | Read it for |
|---|---|---|
| [PRD_0_Master.md](PRD_0_Master.md) | §M | Design and functional principles, app layout, `shared_state` ownership, how stages interact, outputs overview, **session save/load** (§M8), packages, scope |
| [PRD_1_Prepare.md](PRD_1_Prepare.md) | §P | Launch validation and auto-cast, Columns, Transforms, Row Filters, Apply pipeline, Data Preview |
| [PRD_2_Explore.md](PRD_2_Explore.md) | §E | Explore › Plot (Describe, Correlate, Trend, plot types, aesthetics) and Explore › Report (Full / Custom, formats, API) |
| [PRD_3_Analyze.md](PRD_3_Analyze.md) | §A | The analysis workflow: roles and model purpose, Table 1, variable investigation, covariates, model creation, preflight, diagnostics, performance, results, export |
| [NOTE_implementation.md](NOTE_implementation.md) | §N | Pitfalls, the **statistical methods registry** (§N2), and as-built mechanics per stage |
| [NOTE_UI-principles.md](NOTE_UI-principles.md) | — | Layout, action placement, visual hierarchy. Read before any UI work so it isn't reinvented each time |
| [BUILD_Analysis.md](BUILD_Analysis.md) | — | Analyze build phases and acceptance criteria (incl. Phase 5b code generator, Phase 8 export, Phase S sessions) |
| [BUILD_UI-redesign.md](BUILD_UI-redesign.md) | - | **The single UI plan** (Claude + Codex assessments merged 2026-09-22; revised 2026-09-23 from user feedback, §1.3): settled decisions, assessment, and Stages 0-6 - honest locking first, component library, CSS theme, config / result / info page contract with a messages area, flatter navigation. `bslib` + R + plain CSS only. Stage status table at the top; work one stage per session. **§1.3 holds the UI principles taken from real use (button scale, placement by scope, shared settings, no redundant surfaces) - read it before any UI work, alongside `NOTE_UI-principles.md`** |
| [Codex proofing.md](Codex%20proofing.md) | — | Briefing notes for an external proofing agent |
| [tools/PRD_section_map.md](tools/PRD_section_map.md) | — | Old → new section numbers (migration aid), plus the scripts that generated it |

`BUILD_*` files are build plans for a specific piece of functionality, added as that work is planned. `archive/` holds the superseded monolithic PRDs (`EDARK V0.2 - PRD.md`, `EDARK_Analysis_Module_PRD.md`) and the superseded Codex UI assessment (`BUILD_UI-redesign_CODEX.md`) - kept for history only; never cite them.

**Quick lookup**

| Question | Go to |
|---|---|
| Which module owns / may write a `shared_state` field? | §M5.2 |
| Why does this recompute live when everything else waits for a click? | §M2.3 |
| Pipeline order for Apply | §P7.2 |
| Which plot type does a variable pair produce? | §E4, §E8 |
| Where must a p-value or CI be computed? | §N2 (spec §A4.2) |
| What does `reset_analysis_pipeline()` clear? | §A8.6, §N6.13 |
| Preflight check codes | §A8.2; adding a check §N6.12 |
| A reactable table loses its checkbox state | §N1.4 |
| An input still has a value after its UI disappeared | §N1.3 |
| Test dataset features (collinearity, noise, missingness) | §N7 |
| Association vs prediction; validation method (bootstrap / CV / held-out set) | §A1.4a; helpers §N6.2 |

**Precedence:** stage PRD for its stage; Master for anything cross-stage; the PRD wins over code and over §N unless the mismatch is listed under "Doc discrepancies" below.

## Non-Negotiables

Full rationale in the linked sections.

1. **One state object.** All session state in `shared_state` (created in `edark.R`'s `server()`); no `<<-`, no globals; modules talk only through it (§M5).
2. **Module convention.** `foo_ui(id)` + `foo_server(id, shared_state)`; siblings only; all server calls in `edark.R` (§M5.1).
3. **Analyze fields are private.** `analysis_data` / `analysis_spec` / `analysis_result` are read and written only by Analyze modules; Analyze reads Prepare state only at freeze (§M5.3).
4. **Original data is immutable.** `dataset_original` and `original_column_types` are never overwritten. After Apply, `column_types` is updated from the working dataset — the two diverge on purpose, and Columns shows Orig. vs Curr. type (§P2.3).
5. **Compute on click; stage Prepare changes.** Nothing touches `dataset_working` until Apply. Exceptions are only those in §M2.3.
6. **Prepare pipeline order:** start from `dataset_original` → type overrides → column selection → transforms → row filters. Do not reorder (§P7.2).
7. **One statistics engine.** p-values and CIs only via `R/stats_inference.R`; never call `confint*`, `chisq.test`, `fisher.test`, `kruskal.test`, `cor.test` or format a p-value elsewhere (§N2).
8. **`%>%` only**, never `|>` — in app code and generated scripts (§M9.3).
9. **Guard every observer that writes `shared_state` with `!identical()`** (§N1.2); never trust a conditionally rendered input (§N1.3).
10. **One definition per function** — no duplicates across files (§N1.8).

## Current State

- **Prepare, Explore (Plot + Report):** built.
- **Analyze:** Phases 0–7 and 6b complete — Setup (incl. model purpose + train/test split), Table 1, Variable Investigation, Covariate Confirmation, Model Creation, Diagnostics, Performance, Results.
- **Built 2026-09-19:** Phase 7b performance validation — Step 1 validation method (bootstrap / cross-validation / held-out test set, mutually exclusive), settings and Cancel-able runs in Model › Performance (§A1.4a, §A5.3).
- **Stubs and deferrals:** Export (`module_analysis_export.R`, `service_analysis_export.R`) is a placeholder; Phase 8 fills it with export materials, items disabled until created (§A10, §A5.3). Phase 5b's R code generator (`service_analysis_codegen.R`) is deferred — the R Code Preview is a placeholder; it should consume `prepare_snapshot` + the spec (incl. `purpose_specification`).
- **Built 2026-09-23:** UI consistency Stage 1 - honest locking. `R/ui_helpers.R`
  (`EDARK_LOCK_REASON`, `edark_run_button()`, `edark_run_gate()`) and
  `inst/www/edark.css` now exist; every gated Analyze nav item explains itself in a
  popover and every Run button is disabled with its reason visible
  ([BUILD_UI-redesign.md](BUILD_UI-redesign.md) Stage 1).
- **Built 2026-09-23:** UI consistency Stage 2 - component library + one home for aesthetics. `R/ui_helpers.R` gained `edark_section_label()`, `edark_button()`, `edark_action_toolbar()`, `edark_empty_state()`, `edark_message()`, `edark_info_row()`, `edark_model_header()` and `edark_aesthetics_controls()`; the four aesthetics accordions became one `R/module_appearance.R` panel (D9 as amended); Full and Custom reports now generate with the aesthetics on screen (D7)
- **Built 2026-09-23:** UI consistency Stage 3 - the theme file. `inst/www/edark.css` now carries named tokens (status scale, four column-type colours), a calm navbar, one pill treatment per nav level with Analyze stepper states, focus rings, scroll containment and the three absorbed inline `tags$style()` blocks. Dark mode is `bslib::input_dark_mode()` flipping `data-bs-theme` instead of a `flatly <-> darkly` preset swap, so it needs no server code
- **Not started:** Phase S session save / load / autosave (§M8); UI consistency Stages 4–6 ([BUILD_UI-redesign.md](BUILD_UI-redesign.md)).

## Doc Discrepancies to Resolve

Each needs a decision: change the code or change the doc.

- **Analyze step count — §A and the build plan still say nine, code has six.** `module_analysis_main.R` has six top-level `nav_panel`s, with Diagnostics / Performance / Results nested as sub-tabs under **Step 5 Model** and Export as **Step 6**. §N was renumbered to match the code (2026-09-21); `PRD_3_Analyze.md` and `BUILD_Analysis.md` were **not** — doing so touches §A references throughout. Until they are, read §A's "Step 6/7/8" as the Model › Diagnostics / Performance / Results sub-tabs and "Step 9" as Step 6 Export.
- **Trend "count" mode.** Old docs described a "None" trend variable giving `trend_count`, and a `trend_proportion` type. Code: the trend variable is required, and types are `trend_numeric` / `trend_factor`. §E5 documents the code. Decide whether an event-count mode is wanted.
- **Bug — factor trend summary table.** `module_explore_output.R` (~line 179) lists trend types as `trend_count` / `trend_numeric` / `trend_proportion`, so a `trend_factor` plot summarises the timestamp column instead of the trend variable. Fix: use the real type names.
- **Dead renderer.** `render_plot()` dispatches `trend_mean`, which no spec builder produces.
- **Dataset signature.** §A3.2 specifies a structural signature; Step 1 stores a sha256 hash of the data (see the note in §A3.2).
- **Type overrides without UI.** `column_type_overrides` exists in state and pipeline, but no UI sets it (§P4). Keep as a hook or remove.
- **Two Table Ones.** Explore › Report has its own Table One (`.build_tableone_df()`); Analyze has the gtsummary Table 1. Decide: keep both deliberately, or converge. (The two *report systems* are kept separate on purpose - decided 2026-09-22: Explore › Report compiles one document, Analyze › Export produces individual files plus a compilation. See BUILD_UI-redesign.md D1.)
- **Zero baseline default.** `shared_state$trend_zero_baseline` initialises TRUE; the checkbox renders FALSE. §E5 documents FALSE.

## Keeping the Docs Current

- Behaviour change → update the stage PRD (or §M if cross-stage).
- New pitfall or non-obvious mechanic → §N, in the relevant stage section.
- New to-do → root `CLAUDE.md`. Discovered doc/code mismatch → this file.
- Cite sections with their prefix (§P7.2, §A8.6) in code comments and docs.
