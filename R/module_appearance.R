#' Appearance Module
#'
#' The app's single set of plot aesthetics controls, and the only writer of
#' the five aesthetic fields in `shared_state`.
#'
#' Before UI Stage 2 these controls existed four times - Describe, Trend, Full
#' Report and Custom Report - and the two Report copies used separate
#' `custom_*` inputs that were applied at generation time, so a generated
#' report did not match the plot on screen (D7, D9, F4 in
#' `PRD/BUILD_UI-redesign.md`).
#'
#' Appearance is not a mode of the Explore plot, it is one app-level setting
#' that every plot and every report reads, so it is a page of its own - a pill
#' beside Explore Data and Report - rather than a fourth panel in the Explore
#' config pane. Sharing that pane with Describe / Correlate / Trend put a live
#' control row next to three staged ones and spent 340 px on settings that are
#' changed rarely and then left alone.
#'
#' The page has no config pane: its whole content *is* configuration, so the
#' controls sit in the main area as one plain list, each group under an
#' `edark_section_label()` (`edark_aesthetics_groups()`). There are five
#' single-value settings in total - a card apiece framed them as four separate
#' artefacts and spent most of the page on chrome. It is the D6 exception the
#' page contract allows for a page that produces nothing.
#'
#' `appearance_controls_ui()` is the narrow stacked form, kept for any pane
#' that needs it. Only one of the two may be in the document at a time - both
#' emit the same input ids.
#'
#' @param id Character. The module namespace ID.
#' @param shared_state A Shiny `reactiveValues` object.
